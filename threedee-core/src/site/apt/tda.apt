  When Xadrian is started then it begins with a fresh new factory complex as
  shown in this figure:

[images/screen1s.png] Starting with a new empty factory complex

  You can now begin adding factories to this new complex by clicking the
  <Add a factory> hyperlink or by clicking the corresponding function in
  the menu or the toolbar. This will open this dialog window:

[images/screen2s.png] Adding a factory

  Factories are grouped by their races in form of a tree. Select the
  factory (or multiple factories) you want to add to your complex. On the
  right side of the dialog window Xadrian will list useful information about
  the factories. Click OK to add the selected factories to the complex.

  In the complex view a red cross icon is drawn right of each factory
  entry. You can click this icon to remove the factory from the complex.
  
  To change the quantity of a factory simply click the quantity (which
  is a hyperlink). A dialog window will pop up where you can enter the new
  quantity.

  To change the yield of a mine simply click the yield value and enter a
  new yield. You can also enter multiple values to quickly integrated lot of
  mines into the complex.
  
  You can change the sun power by clicking the suns percent value at the
  top of the complex view. This influences the effectivity of solar power
  plants so it's always a good idea to set the correct value here depending
  on the target sector in the game.

  Alternatively you can select a sector for your complex. The sun power is
  then determined automatically.

  Xadrian can automatically calculate the base complex. This means Xadrian can
  add needed factories automatically to get a self-sustaining complex. You
  can enable or disable this feature with the <wand> toolbar button or the
  corresponding item in the <Complex> menu. Xadrian can't add mines to the
  complex automatically. So you will end up with a complex which still needs
  Silicon Wafers or Ore. You have to add mines manually to satisfy these needs.

  Automatically added factories are displayed in gray in the complex view and
  each factory has a blue plus icon at the right. You can click this icon
  to convert an automatically generated factory into a manual one. This is
  useful if you want to <accept> and <fine-tune> the automatically added
  factories.

  A finished complex looks like this:

  As you can see in the production statistics this complex is completely
  self-sustaining.

  Now you know the basics. All other stuff like saving, loading and printing
  should be self-explanatory.
